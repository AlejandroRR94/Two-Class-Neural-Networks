# Two-Class-Neural-Networks

In this repository I build simple two-class classification neural networks (also refered as NN) and tweek their hyperparameters to optimize the scores.

The neural networks are built using the Keras&TensorFlow 2.0. high-level framework, which allows for fast implementation and easy hyperparameter tuning. These NNs will be tweeked by adding neuron layers and finding the best hyperparameter combination via the *GridSearchCV* function.

## Data
The data used is the same as in the *Imbalanced_Data* repository to, not only build neural networks, but to compare its results to the classificators built in the *Imbalanced_Data* repository and will be fetched in the notebook via the *fetch_openml()* function. The dataset is also provided in the *Data* folder.
